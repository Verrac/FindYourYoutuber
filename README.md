# Idea
The entire idea is to build a program so that I and other developers can contribute to a project, build it from the ground up, and eventually make it more complex. The first version which I will release will be strictly command line, but with the help of talented programmer we can add many features to it. Please do not hesitate to work on the project. If this is your first github project this is a perfect one to get some serious credit for development on it. 

# Developer 
The first version of the app will be relased. When that happens this will be updated.
